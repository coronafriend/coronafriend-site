                <h2>5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
                <p>In Short: &nbsp;<em>We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</em></p>
                <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this policy will require us keeping your personal information for longer than 2 years.</p>
                <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

                <p>In some regions (like the European Economic Area), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability.

                <h2>9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2></p>
                <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (&ldquo;DNT&rdquo;) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>
